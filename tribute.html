  <h5>“Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure.”<br><br><em>
– Giuseppe Garibaldi, 6 August 1863.</em></h5><br>
  <h5>“Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.”<br><br><em>-Martin Luther King Jr.</em></h5><br>
